    <br>
  <br>
 
The latest labour market figures published on 15 November contain some worrying signs with employment falling, working age inactivity rising, and increases in involuntary temporary and part-time employment. <br>
  <br>
Duncan Melville, Chief Economist at Learning and Work Institute, commented: <br>
<br>
&#145;Last month I drew attention to the slowing in employment growth. This month the level of employment has actually fallen for the first time in nearly a year. Unemployment has continued to fall but only because of a large rise in economic inactivity amongst people of working age - up by 117,000 in the quarter to July to September 2017. This is the largest rise in inactivity for close to eight years, since November 2009 to January 2010. Inactivity amongst young people not in full-time education stands out as having risen particularly sharply in the quarter. The conclusion is that unemployment is falling not because people are entering work, but rather because they are exiting the labour market. 
<br>
<br>
These signs that the labour market may be breaking bad are supported by the facts that the percentages of people working in temporary jobs because they cannot find a permanent job and working in part-time jobs because they cannot find a full-time job have been rising in recent months. In addition, the benefits statistics show that claimant unemployment is clearly rising. While overall one or two months of data are not a new trend, there are enough worrying signs in today's numbers to mean that we need to keep a watch out for potential trouble ahead, especially in the context of continuing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process and the likelihood that interest rates are gradually on the up.
<br>
<br>The Chancellor has the opportunity in next week's budget to act to ensure that Universal Credit helps rather than hinders those seeking to return to work and more generally to support employment and economic growth in the light of Brexit uncertainty.
&#146; <br>
  <br>
Paul Bivand, AD Statistics and Analysis at Learning and Work, added:<br><br>
&#145;This release shows a rising trend for the claimant count. We also have at the least a bottoming out of a range of unemployment measures. It is really unfortunate that we do not have a consistent benefit series for people becoming unemployed, as this is the earliest indicator of job losses hitting employment. DWP has temporarily removed the new claims for Universal Credit series due to an issue with the data. &#146; <br>
  <br>


Employment fell by 14,000 between April to June 2017 and July to September 2017. In the last 12 months employment has grown by 279,000.   <br>
  <br>
Unemployment fell by 59,000 between April to June 2017 and July to September 2017. and the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 4.3&#37; in the quarter, the joint lowest level since 1975.     <br>
  <br>
 
Economic inactivity rose by 117,000 between April to June 2017 and July to September 2017. and the inactivity rate rose 0.3 percentage points to 21.6&#37; in the quarter.     <br>
  <br> 
 
The small rise in the claimant count takes account of normal seasonal effects but adjusted figures are not published for local areas. The actual number of claimants, nationally, fell by 6,300 in the month to October, compared to the adjusted rise of 1,100. Therefore, it should not be surprising that figures for local areas will show falls compared to the national picture.  
<br>
<br>
The proportion of people leaving the claimant count (or the &#145;leavers rate&#146;) has fallen. At 14.7&#37;, it is now well below the level in early 2015 of 18.8&#37;. The number of new claims has fallen. Jobseeker&#146;s Allowance off-flow rates for JSA claimants of short durations increased. Off-flow rates remain at historically high levels. 
<br>
  <br>
Youth unemployment is showing a quarterly fall. There are still 517,000 unemployed young people, and 340,000 (4.8&#37; of the youth population) who are unemployed and not in full-time education.  However, the inactivity rate for those not in full-time education is sharply up, by 1.2 percentage points in the quarter.<br>
  <br>
The proportion of unemployed young people (not counting students) who are not claiming Jobseeker&#146;s Allowance and therefore are not receiving official help with job search is now 52.0&#37;. <br>
  <br>
 
A total of 73,000 were counted as in employment while on &#145;government employment and training programmes&#146;, where the Office for National Statistics continues to count Work Programme (etc.) participants as &#145;in employment&#146; by default. This number rose 3,000 this quarter. Self-employment rose 4,000 this quarter. Employee numbers fell 10,000 in the quarter. Involuntary part-time employment rose this quarter by 16,000 to 1.05 million, 12.4&#37; of all part-time workers.The proportion remains nearly double that in 2004.
